# RadioTris
RadioTris was a project developed during the tenth edition of the "Neapolis Innovation Summer Campus" held at STMicroelectronics in Arzano. This project replicated the game of Tic-Tac-Toe on an STM32-G474RE board, implementing the possibility of playing remotely using Radio Frequency technology. The work was carried out in C using ChibiStudio. In a small internal competition of the course, this project ranked third.
